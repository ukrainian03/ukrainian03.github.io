  <h1>Usability</h1>
  <h2>Misc</h2>
  <p>I validated my HTML on all four pages to make sure I did not have any errors and each page was functioning. 
  I also validated my CSS on certain pages, and the stylesheet, to make sure there were no errors. I tested different colors
  on WCAG page, to pick which colors were user friendly. I then went to WAVE, to check my style and contrast errors, and there
  you are able to simulate different colors on the page, before actually coding it. Here I tested my headings color against my pink background
    and it passed all levels.</p>
  <h2>Home Page</h2>
  <p>On my home page, I had trouble with my original layout idea. I wanted to place my title at the top, with my picture underneath, and
  my name under my image. However, I couldn't get it to work, and resulted to a table. To my surprise it actually looked pretty neat. 
  I wanted my name to be a little unique, since it is, so I made a gradient and it took me about an hour to place the points correctly.</p>
  <h2>About Me Page</h2>
  <p>The layout is pretty standar with text, utilizing first headings and paragraphs. I used lists for a cleaner look. 
  For the video, I made sure it did not automatically play, but I did want the sound still there as it is an ice skating 
  rink and helped to see why I love it. Worked samples are to include my Caeser Cipher.</p>
  <h2>Photography Page</h2>
  <p>Placed two copies of my SVG I hand drew in Inkscape. Used a table to organize the photos better, because I am not very skilled in layouts.
  The table format was implemented already through my css worksheet. I created thumbnails for my images for an even smoother layout, and then
  there is the ability to click on it for a larger view of my work.</p>
  <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
  <p>I had to pay extra attention in class to obtain half the code and consulted w3schools for the rest. To make sure it worked, 
  I tested it out on my page and success. I used the Ascii Table for the complete alphabet. I used a loop as I had multiple of the same lines of code, and a conditional statement.
  I even added a button for more pizzazz.</p>
