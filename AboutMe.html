    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <span id="name"> Yevheniya Krasynska.</span> Shortly after I was born (in UA), I moved to sunnyside Florida with my parents and sister.
      I am a FTIC sophmore at FGCU and live off campus. I currently study Political Science
      with a concentration in International Relations, and a minor in Computer Science Informations. I tend to have a rush of excitement
      when starting new projects, but the longer it takes to complete, my patience runs out. I have done a lot of community service
      and like to be hands on.<br/><br/>I am almost always dependent. I love helping my friends out from homework to advice to errands. 
    I like roller coasters, football and working out. My favorite color is red. I hate spicy food and people who aren't straight forward.
      I like a hectic schedule sometimes, because I hate wasting a day sitting around.<br/><br/> One of my favorite hobbies
      is ice skating, even though I'm not the best at it. It makes me feel free and happy. </p>
