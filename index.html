    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is <span id="name"> Yevheniya Krasynska.</span> Shortly after I was born (in UA), I moved to sunnyside Florida with my parents and sister.
      I am a FTIC sophmore at FGCU and live off campus. I currently study Political Science
      with a concentration in International Relations, and a minor in Computer Science. I tend to have a rush of excitement
      when starting new projects, but the longer it takes to complete, my patience runs out. I have done a lot of community service
      and like to be hands on.<br/><br/>I am almost always dependent. I like roller coasters,
      football and working out. My favorite color is red. I hate spicy food and people who don't speak their minds.
      I like a hectic schedule sometimes, I hate doing nothing all day because to me it is a wasted day. </p>
